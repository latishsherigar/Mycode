Title: Print Word Doc From Access v.2
Description: Finally!!! It works!!! I posted a version of this that didn't work. Now it does!! It prints reports in Word Docs just as if they were Access reports. In other words you can print them based on criteria just like you can with Access reports. Don't worry about voting or anything. I just posted it thinking that someone may find it useful. If you have any suggestions then please to email me. Enjoy!!

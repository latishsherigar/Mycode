Latish     I attach some notes and spreadsheets which describe what we need
I will also send you a handwritten layout of the new input screen
the programme and the spreadsheets will be in drive   D/mba/hains but I will be testing it on drive c/mba/hains, so I need  a way of choosing the drive to use when we start


will you give me an estimate of the number of hours you need and the price
I want you to do the job but my company has a policy of sending work out to 3 programmers, so I need a low price.
We will have more programmes needed on this project
It is the same project you wrote a prog for last time


if you need any more help let me know

speed is very important, because we are now installing the new sytems

thanks  George
